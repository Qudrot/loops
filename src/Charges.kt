/* A parking garage charges 200 naira minimum fee to park for three hours in a day.
* An additional charge of 50 naira per hour on every hour in excess of three hours.
* The maximum charge for 24 hours however is 1000 naira.
* Assuming that no car parked for longer than 24 hours in a day.
* You are required to write an algorithm to calculate the charges for a customer.
* Your algorithm is expected to calculate and print out the customerâ€™s charges for
* the standard three hours charge, his charges for additional hours and the total charges.
* Note that the maximum daily charge is 1000 naira.
* Include in your algorithm the logic to make it impossible to print out daily charges more than 1000 */
