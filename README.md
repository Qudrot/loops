# loops 

The algorithm for the task was completed using loops and if-else statements.
Some of the task was solve with combination of loops, when loops, for loops and while loops and do..while loops. Other task are much better suited to one type of loop than the other. In addition, some of the task required multiple loops. When multiple loops are involved, one loop might need to be nested inside the other.

If statement was use to Make a decision, selected one of two alternatives with an if-else statement, Selected from one of several alternatives by using an if-else or if-else-else statement.
Constructed a complex condition for an if statement that includes the Boolean operators and, or and not.
Also nested an if statement within the body of another if statement
